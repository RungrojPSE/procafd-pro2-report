To preprocess this graph and remove cycles, you can use a cycle detection algorithm such as **Tarjan's algorithm** for finding Strongly Connected Components (SCCs) or a simple DFS-based approach to identify and break cycles. Here's how you can do it step by step:

---

### **1. Represent the Graph**

Convert the nodes and edges into a usable adjacency list representation:

```python
nodes = [
    {'id': 1},
    {'id': 2},
    {'id': 3},
    {'id': 4},
    {'id': 5},
]
edges = [
    {'from': 1, 'to': 2},
    {'from': 2, 'to': 3},
    {'from': 3, 'to': 4},
    {'from': 4, 'to': 2},
    {'from': 4, 'to': 5},
]

# Create an adjacency list
graph = {}
for node in nodes:
    graph[node['id']] = []

for edge in edges:
    graph[edge['from']].append(edge['to'])

print(graph)
# Output: {1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [2, 5], 5: []}
```

---

### **2. Detect and Remove Cycles**

To break cycles, we can remove back edges (edges that form cycles in the graph). Here's an implementation:

```python
def dfs(node, graph, visited, stack, back_edges):
    visited.add(node)
    stack.add(node)

    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if neighbor not in visited:
            dfs(neighbor, graph, visited, stack, back_edges)
        elif neighbor in stack:  # Cycle detected
            back_edges.append((node, neighbor))  # Store the edge causing the cycle

    stack.remove(node)

def remove_cycles(graph):
    visited = set()
    stack = set()
    back_edges = []

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node, graph, visited, stack, back_edges)

    # Remove back edges
    for from_node, to_node in back_edges:
        graph[from_node].remove(to_node)

    return back_edges

# Remove cycles
back_edges = remove_cycles(graph)
print("Back edges removed (causing cycles):", back_edges)
print("Graph after removing cycles:", graph)
```

---

### **3. Output**

After running the above code:

- **Back edges removed:** `[(4, 2)]`
  - This edge `4 â†’ 2` forms a cycle and is removed.
- **Graph after removing cycles:**
  ```python
  {1: [2], 2: [3], 3: [4], 4: [5], 5: []}
  ```

---

### **4. Perform DFS Without Cycles**

Now that the graph is acyclic, you can safely perform DFS without worrying about infinite recursion due to cycles.

```python
def dfs_clean(node, graph, visited, result):
    if node in visited:
        return
    visited.add(node)
    result.append(node)
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        dfs_clean(neighbor, graph, visited, result)

# Example DFS
visited = set()
result = []
dfs_clean(1, graph, visited, result)
print("DFS result:", result)
# Output: DFS result: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

---

### Summary

1. **Detect and remove cycles:** Use DFS to find back edges and remove them.
2. **Simplify the graph:** The graph becomes a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
3. **Perform DFS:** With cycles removed, DFS works efficiently.
